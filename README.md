# CriminalIntent
An Android app that makes office managment interesting and efficient.

*This application was made with the help of the Big Nerd Ranch: Android Programming book.*
NOTE: This app is still in development. 

This app is essentially a database of filed complaints or "office crimes" submitted by employees about other individuals. It allows users to make a complaint, file it against a particular individual in the database, and displays the list of all office crimes to all users. 

Once again, this was just a project to understand more ideas of Android development, such as Fragment hosting / lifecycles, RecyclerPager, ViewPager, and other interesting Views. It also introduced SQLite Android development. However, I am still working on that phase. I took some time off this project to devote myself to Meeple.
